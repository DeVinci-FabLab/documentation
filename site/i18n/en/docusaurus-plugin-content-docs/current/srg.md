# Safety, Storage and Waste (SSW) : Guide to Good Practices in the Fablab

> Welcome to the **SSW** training (Safety, Storage, Waste), which presents the basics of how the DeVinci Fablab operates and the best practices to adopt in the space.

## <Info /> Training Objectives

- Use the DeVinci Fablab spaces in good conditions.
- Know the association's expectations towards its users.
- Adopt a responsible, respectful, and collaborative attitude.

## <AlertTriangle /> Safety

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

The first universal rule, before using any machine or technique, is to put yourself in the right state of concentration. Then, equip yourself with the necessary PPE, which can be found in the **protection drawer** under the main workbench.

Each PPE should be used according to the hazard to be avoided. Here are the main types of hazards identified in the Fablab and the associated protections:

#### Cuts

- **Cut-resistant gloves are mandatory**
- **Safety glasses recommended**
- Never rely solely on your skills: the Fab is a lively space, and a moment of distraction can happen quickly.

#### Burns

- Some equipment or tools can reach high temperatures and cause serious burns.
- **Thermal gloves are mandatory** when handling this equipment to avoid direct contact with the heat source, thus reducing risks.

#### Projections

- Applies to dremels, drills (manual or column), cutters.
- Wood and metal are not the only things that can injure: **hot PLA can also be dangerous**.
- **Gloves and glasses are mandatory**.

#### Fine particles

- Paint, spray varnish, resin sanding…
- **Fine particle mask** + **well-ventilated area required**.

#### Noise

- Very noisy tools must be **used on floor -1**.
- If used in the Fab: check that you are not disturbing anyone and **wear hearing protection**.

#### Fast rotation

- **Hair must be tied back**
- Be careful with gloves or fingers when changing drill bits.

:::tip
Always think about what you are doing. Tools are only dangerous **when misused**.
:::

### Emergencies

In case of need:

| Service          | Number |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Ambulance (SAMU) | 15     |
| Police           | 17     |
| Firefighters     | 18     |
| Europe Emergency | 112    |

- Two fire extinguishers are located **to the right of the 3D printer farm**: one water, one CO₂.
- **Use only the CO₂ extinguisher on electrical machines.**
- **Smoke detectors**: smoking is prohibited and **the fume extractor is mandatory for soldering irons**.

## <Boxes /> Storage

### Courtesy Rules

The DeVinci Fablab is a collaborative space where many people use the same work area. Therefore, it is essential to respect others, as well as yourself, in the use of tools and workbenches.

- Leave the space **as you would like to find it**, or even **better**.
- You are **entitled to remind someone** if this rule is not respected.

:::info
Tidying up an area even if you are not responsible for it is **an act of collective respect** encouraged by the board.
:::

### Storage Areas

Every tool, electronic part, project, etc. has its place:

- **Tool wall**: light tools (hammers, screwdrivers…). Each spot is labeled.
- **Metal drawers** under this wall: heavy tools (dremels, drills, glue guns…), associated accessories, and PPE.
- **Under the resin station**: glues, varnishes, paints, spray or tube products.
- **Drawers at soldering stations** (in the [electronics space](spaces_charters/electronics.md)): each station has its own kit. **Do not move them.**

#### Black cabinets

- Reserved for electronics.
- **Mandatory sorting by value** for components (e.g., resistors).
- Disorder in these storage areas can **damage circuits and waste everyone's time**.

:::tip
If you have any doubts, don't hesitate to look for yourself or ask; only experience will allow you to know everything.
:::

### Project Management

With the aim of keeping as many work areas available as possible at all times, it is important to manage your projects responsibly:

- Any abandoned or unmarked project **may be stored/disassembled at any time**.
- For a temporary stop, leave a note. But **no more than one day without explicit request**.
- Ask for a **project box** (via the board) if you need to store for longer.

:::warning
**Academic projects (PIX, PIX2, etc.) are prohibited in project boxes.**
They are reserved for members' personal projects.
:::

## <Trash2 /> Waste

### Use of Consumables

The DeVinci Fablab provides many resources for free, but that is not a reason to waste them. The general rule is that every consumable you take must serve a specific and thoughtful purpose.

- **Take only what you need.**
- Avoid unnecessary prints: it's possible to print fun things, but it must be **justified** (gift, decoration, test…).
- Same for electronics: don't take a handful of components "just in case".
- **Report** if you break a tool! No problem, but if you don't say anything, it becomes unusable for everyone.

### Project Recycling

- The **Schrödinger Box** at the back of the [fabrication space](spaces_charters/fabrication.md) is the **self-service reuse area**:
  - Drop off your parts there if they have reuse potential.
  - Feel free to help yourself, you can **even take the parts home**.

## <Lightbulb /> In summary

- **Be attentive to what you are doing.**
- **Leave the place better than you found it.**
- **Report when something is wrong.**
- **Respect the community.**
