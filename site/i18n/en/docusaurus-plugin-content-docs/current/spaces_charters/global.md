The DeVinci Fablab is a collective, open, and shared space. To ensure everyone can use it under the best conditions, **certain rules apply to all areas**, regardless of equipment or activity.

## <PackageOpen /> Use of Resources and Equipment

- **Do not use equipment that is not at your disposal.** If it's not in the [Schrödinger Box](../srg#le-recyclage-des-projets), **do not touch it**.
- **Equipment never leaves the Fablab.** It cannot be borrowed for outside or personal use under any circumstances.
- **Do not take tools home**—even for a short project, a repair, or “just for the weekend.”
- **Turn off machines** when not in use.
  _Exception: FDM 3D printers._
- **Notify a board member** if you finish a consumable (filament, glue, screws, etc.).

:::tip
If you are unsure about the accessibility or availability of a tool, **ask a referent or area manager.**
:::

## <Pin /> Storage and Cleanliness

- **Always tidy up after yourself**—tools, cables, consumables, surfaces.
- **A clean space is a usable space.**
  Think of those who will come after you, even if you are alone in the room.
- **All equipment must be returned exactly where you found it.**
  If it's not clear, ask a referent.

## <AlertTriangle /> Respect for Usage Rules

- **Never block access** to emergency exits or safety devices.
- **The specific rules for each area** (resin, textile, electronics, fabrication, etc.) fully apply.
- **Repeated failure** to follow the rules may have consequences such as temporary or permanent exclusion from the space.
- **The Fablab is a shared space**: always act as you would want others to act.

:::caution
A disorganized or damaged Fablab is an unusable Fablab.
The collective only works **if everyone does their part**.
:::

## <Siren /> In Case of Doubt or Problem

- **Contact a board member** or area referent.
- There is **no shame in not knowing**, asking a question, or seeking help. On the contrary, it's **a sign of good use of the space**.

Thank you to everyone for applying these rules with rigor and kindness. This is what allows us to make the Fablab a pleasant, safe, and sustainable space for all.
