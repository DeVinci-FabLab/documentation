# Resin Space Charter

## <FileText size={32} /> Space Description

- The resin space is dedicated to 3D printing with photosensitive resins, as well as associated steps: cleaning, post-processing, curing, and finishing.
- Due to the **toxicity of the products handled**, access is **strictly reserved for trained individuals**, and safety rules must be applied **rigorously**.

## <TriangleAlert size={32} /> Safety Rules

- **Access prohibited without prior training**.
- **Wearing nitrile gloves is mandatory** for any handling.
- **Lab coat or protective clothing** recommended to avoid splashes.
- **Safety glasses strongly recommended** during risky operations.
- **Mask wearing is mandatory** for long manipulations or those generating vapors.
- **Absolutely no food or drink** in the space.
- **Any object in the space is considered toxic** (including tools, bottles, funnels), unless otherwise indicated.
- **A glove removed = glove consumed**: put on a new pair.
- **Ventilation is mandatory** during the use of resin or solvents.
- **Never leave a chemical product open** or without a clear label.
- **Maintenance prohibited without specific training**.

## <CheckSquare size={32} /> Best Practices and Recommendations

- Be accompanied during your first prints after training by a fully trained member.
- Immediately dispose of resin residues after each handling.
- Use **only one type** of resin per tank and print.
- **Never scratch or scrape resin tanks**: use only **non-abrasive tools** for cleaning or filtering.
- Always replace the filters of tanks or funnels after use.
- Use only wooden sticks for mixing.
- **Never pour liquid waste** into a sink — even diluted.
- Be present during the entire print cycle, do not leave a print unattended.
- Always cover the Saturn with its anti-UV lid when not in use.
- **Post-it required** for any experiment needing resting time: name, surname, date, start and end time.
- Any consumable or equipment (funnel, tank, spatula, etc.) is considered **single-use**: if it is no longer new, it must be discarded.

## <Wrench size={32} /> Available Equipment

- Resin printers:
  - Saturn 3 12K
  - Saturn 4 16K
  - Form 3
- Isopropyl alcohol washing station (Form Wash)
- UV oven (Form Cure)
- Vacuum pump
- Nitrile gloves, respirator masks, safety glasses
- Wooden sticks, filters, disposable funnels

## <Pin size={32} /> Storage and Cleaning

- **Systematically clean** the workspace after use.
- **Replace all protections** (lids, caps, boxes) after each print.
- **Dispose of all waste** (gloves, cloths, filters, residues) in the bins provided for this purpose.

## <Siren size={32} /> In Case of Problem

- Immediately report any incident, malfunction, or anomaly to a referent or the person responsible for the space.
- Do not intervene alone on a machine without authorization or training.

## <Phone size={32} /> Contacts
