## <FileText /> Space Description

- The manufacturing area is a workshop for **machining**, **assembly**, and **manual or machine-assisted manufacturing** of various projects involving wood, metal, plastic, and composite materials.
- It includes **manual work areas**, power tools, and conventional machines (drill press, sander, scroll saw, etc.).

## <TriangleAlert /> Safety Rules

- **Wearing appropriate PPE** for the activity is mandatory: goggles, mask, ear defenders, gloves (with some exceptions).
- **Wear appropriate clothing** that does not restrict your movement, avoiding accessories that could get caught in the machines (such as scarves, bracelets, puffed sleeves, etc.).
- **Long hair must be tied back**.
- **Never use a machine without prior training** or approval from a supervisor.
- **Always check that the safety features** of machines are working properly before use.
- **Never leave a machine running unattended.**
- **Never wear gloves when using motorized rotary tools.**
- **Be stable when cutting**: do not cut over a void; use **a vise or a holding device**.

## <CheckSquare /> Best Practices and Recommendations

- Visually check the condition of tools before use (blades, drill bits, abrasives, etc.).
- Plan the manufacturing steps before starting to avoid errors and accidents.
- **Do not use too much hot glue**: a small amount is sufficient.
- **Work cleanly and tidily** to limit risks (objects lying around, cables on the floor, etc.).
- Test on a scrap piece before any final cutting or machining.
- Handle cutting tools **with care**, even when not in use.
- Immediately report any breakdowns, malfunctions, or suspicious wear and tear.
- Use **appropriate holding devices** (vices, clamps) for the parts to be machined.
- **Tools are self-service**, but must always **be returned to exactly where they came from** (see [SSW](../srg.md)).
- Do not hesitate to inform other users in case of doubt or questions.

## <Wrench /> Available Equipment

- Scroll saw
- Drill press
- Sander
- Power tools: screwdrivers, drills, grinders, circular saws
- Hand tools: hammers, screwdrivers, hand saws, pliers, wrenches, cutters
- Measuring instruments: rulers, squares, tape measures, calipers
- Consumables: screws, glues, adhesives, abrasives
- Schr√∂dinger Box: reuse space for unused parts and materials

## <Pin /> Storage and Cleaning

- **Always clean the work area after use.**
- **Clean up chips and dust** after cutting or sanding.
- **Put each tool back in its place** immediately after use.
- **Turn off and unplug machines** before leaving the area.

## <Siren /> In Case of Problem

- Stop using a machine immediately if it behaves abnormally or makes a suspicious noise.
- Notify a supervisor or manager if you have any doubts.
