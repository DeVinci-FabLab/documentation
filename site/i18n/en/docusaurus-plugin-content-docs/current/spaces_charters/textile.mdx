# Textile Space Charter

## <FileText size={32} /> Space Description

- The textile space is dedicated to textile creation: sewing, embroidery, textile printing (flocking), textile cutting (Cricut), simple textile repairs, and creative fabric projects.
- This space allows members to carry out personal or collective projects requiring sewing or textile design skills.

## <TriangleAlert size={32} /> Safety Rules
- Do not eat or drink in the space (to avoid stains and accidents with the machines).
- Do not use the machines without prior validation from a trained member.
- Do not change machine settings other than basic ones (upper thread tension, stitch length, temperature and timer for the heat press, etc.) without authorization from a supervisor.
- Always turn off and unplug machines after use.
- Keep the workspace clear around machines to avoid any risk of accident (e.g., cables, tools).
- Pay special attention when using needle machines (sewing machines, overlockers) to avoid accidents.

## <CheckSquare size={32} /> Best Practices and Recommendations

- Sewing scissors must be used exclusively for cutting fabric or thread (not leather, paper, interfacing, zippers, etc.).
- Do not use the tables for anything other than textile work.
- Replace the protective film on Cricut mats and use only the mat appropriate for the intended use.
- Respect items reserved for MDD.
- Check the condition of needles and replace them if necessary (with prior agreement if the user does not know how to proceed).
- Check the thread condition before use to avoid breakage or machine jams.
- Immediately report any machine malfunction.
- If a machine breaks down or needs maintenance, immediately place a clear sign indicating the problem and notify a technical referent.

- Sewing machines
- Embroidery machine
- Cricut cutter and associated mats
- Heat press

## <Pin size={32} /> Storage and Cleaning

- Clean or request cleaning of deposits after using machines, especially the overlocker or after using fabrics like velvet.
- Put away all used equipment after use.
- Cut fabric cleanly and use scraps to reduce textile waste.
- Use fabric scraps if possible before taking new fabrics.
- Regularly clean the machines (remove dust and accumulated textile residues).

## <Siren size={32} /> In Case of Problem

- Immediately report any incident or technical problem to a technical referent or the person responsible for the space.
- Clearly indicate any identified problem on a note or sign to warn other users.
