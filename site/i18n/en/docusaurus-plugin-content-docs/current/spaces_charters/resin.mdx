# Resin Space Charter

## <FileText size={32} /> Space Description

- The resin space is specifically designed for 3D printing with photosensitive resin, as well as associated operations: cleaning, post-processing, curing, and finishing of printed parts.
- It requires increased vigilance and strict adherence to safety rules due to the chemicals and toxic products handled. Access is strictly reserved for trained individuals.

## <TriangleAlert size={32} /> Safety Rules

- **Access strictly prohibited without prior training**.
- Always work with a lab coat or protective clothing to avoid splashes on clothes.
- Wearing nitrile gloves is mandatory for any handling.
- Never perform machine maintenance without prior training.
- Absolutely no food or drink allowed in the space.
- Any object in the resin space is considered toxic unless otherwise indicated (e.g., resin parts cured after UV oven).
- If you remove your nitrile gloves, they are considered used and must be replaced immediately.
- Safety glasses are strongly recommended when handling materials with splash risk.
- Regular ventilation is mandatory to limit the accumulation of toxic vapors.
- Never leave chemicals open or without clear labeling.
- Wear a mask during long manipulations to avoid prolonged inhalation.

## <CheckSquare size={32} /> Best Practices and Recommendations

- Immediately dispose of resin residues after each handling.
- Use **only one type** of resin per print.
- For your first prints after training, be accompanied by a fully trained member.
- Never use abrasive tools on resin tanks during cleaning or filtering. Use only soft tools to avoid scratches.
- Do not leave the Saturn machine without its UV cover to avoid damage.
- Always use wooden sticks for mixing.
- **Never** pour liquid waste down a sink.
- Be present for the entire printing cycle; do not leave productions in the machines unattended.
- For any experiment requiring rest or prolonged waiting, write your name, surname, date, and start/end times on a post-it note.
- Open windows in case of non-photosensitive mixing to ensure good ventilation.
- All equipment in the space is considered consumable: if it is no longer new, it must be discarded.
- Always replace the tank or funnel filter after use.

## <Wrench size={32} /> Available Equipment

- Resin printers:
  - Saturn 3 12k
  - Saturn 4 16k
  - Forms 3
- Isopropyl alcohol washing station (Forms Wash)
- UV oven (Forms Cure)
- Vacuum pump
- Nitrile gloves, respirator masks, safety glasses
- Wooden sticks

## <Pin size={32} /> Storage and Cleaning

- Always clean the space after use.
- Dispose of solid and liquid resin residues in the designated bins.
- Immediately put all protections back in place after use (UV covers, various protections, etc.).

## <Siren size={32} /> In Case of Problem

- In case of incident, malfunction, or doubt, immediately notify a manager or technical referent.
- Never attempt to repair or intervene on a machine alone without proper training.

## <Phone size={32} /> Contacts
