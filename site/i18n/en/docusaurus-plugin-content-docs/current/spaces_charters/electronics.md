:::info
The electronic space is managed and maintained by the [**DaVinciBot (DVB)**](https://docs.davincibot.fr/) association. If you have any questions, problems, or requests for equipment, please contact a member of DVB.

## <FileText /> Space Description

- The electronic space is dedicated to the design, prototyping, and repair of electronic circuits.
- It includes soldering equipment, measuring devices (multimeters, oscilloscopes), and various electronic components.

## <TriangleAlert /> Safety Rules

- **No eating or drinking in the electronic space** to avoid any risk of electrocution or equipment damage.
- **Never leave a hot soldering iron unattended.**
- **Always use an extraction fan when soldering.**
- **Avoid contact with hot elements** (soldering iron, recently soldered components, heat gun, etc.).
- Do not exceed **320 °C for soldering** and **350 °C for desoldering** — or ask a referent for help if needed.
- **Never work on a circuit with voltage above 24 V** without supervision or proper training.

## <CheckSquare /> Best Practices and Recommendations

- Clean the soldering iron tip before each use.
- Check temperature settings before turning on a soldering station.
- Cut wires cleanly after soldering to avoid short circuits.
- Test assemblies on breadboard before any permanent soldering.
- Use a **consistent color code** for cables (red = V+, black = ground, etc.).
- Handle measuring devices (multimeter, oscilloscope, etc.) with care — ask for advice if needed.
- **Use already opened components first** before starting new ones.
- Check component polarity before soldering to avoid short circuits or explosions (e.g., electrolytic capacitors).
- **Working on a grounded chair** (like the big black chair in the space) minimizes the risks associated with electrostatic discharge.
- **Keep your workspace clean and organized** when handling electronics.

## <Wrench /> Available Equipment

- Soldering stations and soldering irons
- Measuring devices: multimeters, oscilloscopes, signal generators
- Adjustable laboratory power supplies
- Various tools: wire cutters, strippers, screwdrivers, anti-static pliers, grounding wrist straps
- Electronic components: resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, microcontrollers, sensors
- Prototyping equipment: breadboards, jumper wires, blank PCB boards

:::note
Electronic components and prototyping equipment are available **upon request** from **DVB**. Please do not take anything without prior approval.
:::

## <Pin /> Storage and Cleaning

- **Put each tool back in its place** immediately after use.
- **Clean the soldering stations** (tin residues, brush the tip), then **turn off and unplug**.
- **Return all unused components** to their original storage.
- **Do not mix** components to ensure they remain in good condition.

## <Siren /> In Case of Problem

- Report any breakdown, damage, or malfunction to a manager or technical referent at **DVB**.
- Never intervene alone on unknown or damaged equipment without prior validation.
