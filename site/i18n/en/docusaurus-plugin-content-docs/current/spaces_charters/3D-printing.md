# 3D Printing Space Charter

## <FileText /> Space Description

- This space is dedicated to 3D printing by fused filament deposition (FDM).
- It allows the creation of prototypes, technical or decorative parts using printers accessible to everyone after training.
- You will find several FDM printers, post-processing tools, and different types of filaments.

## <TriangleAlert /> Safety Rules

- **No eating or drinking in the space**, to protect the machines and avoid any incident.
- **Never intervene on a machine without having been trained** or without validation from a referent.
- **Never touch the nozzle or heated bed during or just after printing**: they can exceed 200 °C.
- **Do not open or move a printer while it is printing**

## <CheckSquare /> Best Practices and Recommendations

- **Make sure to select in the slicer the filament that matches the one loaded on the printer**.
- Do not touch the post-its on the printers.
- Make sure the bed is clean. Clean if necessary with isopropyl alcohol.
- **Monitor the first layers**: if the filament does not adhere, stop the print immediately.
- Prepare and slice STL files in advance.
- After each filament loading, update the corresponding information on the printer.
- Report any anomaly (clogged nozzle, irregular extrusion, etc.).
- Never remove a part while hot: wait for the bed to cool or use a suitable spatula.
- Store spools in a dry place to prevent moisture absorption.

## <Wrench /> Available Equipment

- FDM 3D printers:
  - 7 Bambulab A1 mini
  - 2 Bambulab P1S
- Filament spools: PLA, PETG, TPU (others upon validation)
- Computer with slicing software installed
- Spatulas, wire cutters

## <Pin /> Storage and Cleaning

- **Clean the print surface** if necessary (residues, glue, etc.).
- **Put away used tools** (spatulas, pliers, cutters) in their dedicated place.
- **Store spools** on the rails under the printers or in the shelves provided for this purpose.

## <Siren /> In Case of Problem

- Report any breakdown or anomaly to a manager or technical referent.
- Do not force a part, cover, or nozzle: any blockage must be diagnosed calmly.
- Indicate on a post-it if a printer is out of order, and do not restart it until the issue has been resolved.
