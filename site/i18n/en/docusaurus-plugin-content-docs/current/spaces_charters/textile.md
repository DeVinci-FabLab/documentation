## <FileText /> Space Description

- The textile space is dedicated to **textile creation** : sewing, embroidery, flocking, textile cutting (Cricut), simple repairs, and creative projects.
- It allows members to carry out **personal or collective projects**, requiring sewing, cutting, or textile design skills.

## <TriangleAlert /> Safety Rules

- **No eating or drinking** in the space to avoid stains and reduce the risk of accidents with the machines.

- **Keep the area around machines clear** to avoid falls and snags.
- Pay **special attention when using needle machines** (sewing machines, sergers).

- **Use sewing scissors only for fabric or thread** â€“ never for leather, paper, interfacing, zippers, etc.
- Do not use the tables for anything other than textile work.
- **Put the protective film back** on Cricut mats after use, and **use the mat suitable** for each material.
- Respect items reserved for [Maison DeVinci Durable (MDD)](https://www.instagram.com/maison_devinci/) (do not use them).
- Check the condition of needles and change them if necessary (ask for help if needed).
- Check the condition of the thread to avoid jams or breakage.
- **Immediately report any malfunction**.
- If a machine breaks down or needs maintenance, **place a clear note on the machine** and inform a referent.
