## Internationalization (I18N)

Use the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) standard for language codes when naming translation files.

## Documentation

Documentation is required for all contributions (code, issues, or pull requests). It should be:

* Clear and concise
* Written in Markdown
* Included in the main `README.md` when applicable
* Supplemented in the `docs/` folder if more detail is needed

### Adding New Documentation

1. Ensure your Markdown file is well-structured and follows the project's documentation style.
   * Use headings, lists, and code blocks to enhance readability.
   * Include table of contents, images where necessary, using relative paths.
   * Use the provided `site/static/assets/template.md` for consistency.
2. Place your Markdown file in `site/docs/<your-section>/<your-file>.md`.
3. Add the English version in `site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/<your-section>/<your-file>.md`.
4. If your file has images, place them in `site/static/assets/docs/<your-file>/`.
5. Update `site/sidebar.ts` to add your file to the sidebar navigation.
6. If you are introducing a new category, update:

   * `site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current.json`
   * `site/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current.json`

Ensure your documentation is well-structured and easy to navigate.

* As simple as possible
* Fully documented in the `README.md`

## Testing

## Git Strategy

All contributions should follow the [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching model. The main branches are:

* `main`: The main branch for the project. This branch should always be stable and deployable.
* `develop`: The development branch for the project. All feature branches should be merged into this branch.
* `feature/*`: Feature branches for new functionality. These branches should be merged into the `develop` branch.
* `hotfix/*`: Hotfix branches for critical bug fixes. These branches should be merged into the `main` and `develop` branches.
* `release/*`: Release branches for preparing a new release. These branches should be merged into the `main` and `develop` branches.
* `support/*`: Support branches for long-term support. These branches should be merged into the `main` branch.
* `docs/*`: Documentation branches for updating the documentation. These branches should be merged into the `main` branch.
